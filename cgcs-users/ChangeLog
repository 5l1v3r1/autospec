0.3e - a buffer overflow and a string bug, both found by RazoR (Nikolay Alexandrov), fixed.
0.3d - a format string vulnerability, found by Kim Streich, is fixed.
0.3b-0.3c - bugfixes.
0.3a	- The admin has the opportunity, to create separate cmds file for each user. 
	This way the sysadmin has complete control over sensitive applications, which
	should only be allowed to a selected few.
 	- The admin has the opportunity, to create separate xtns file for each user. 
	- The extensions policy has been changed. Now both globals.xtns and the user
	extension files will list the extensions, that are _allowed_ ! In earlier versions,
	the forbidden extensions were listed, that is allow everything, except to deny a few.
	From this version on, it's deny everything, except allow the ones, listed in these files.
	- While the code for the search of illegal/dangerous material stored in user space is
	back, it will not erase any files any more. Instead, it will remove all
	rights from that file, so it can not be executed, or read. Files, with the +x bit set,
	will be chmodded to -x. This is another "defense line" to stop the user to execute
	programs, stored in user space.
	- The access to all linux binaries, and source code files, stored in user space, if any, 
	will be blocked.
	- Absolute path for restricted users can not be longer then 255 characters. All files,
	that are longer (with full path), will be renamed.
	- Minor bug fixes.

0.2a	- Major bug fixes. 
	- User activities are logged with syslog.
	- hhsytem revised, hardened. /bin/sh isnt involved anymore into program starting.
	If the home directory is in the PATH, it's ignored.
	- erasing illegal content is temporarily suspended and removed.

0.1b	- Major bug fixes.
	- The config files are accidentally missing from this release!

0.1a	- The first version of the program.
